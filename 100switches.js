/*
There are 100 switches in a room operating 100 bulbs. Initially all switches are off. You are asked to make 100 passes through them, in such a manner that during i th pass all the switches that are multiples of i are toggled (if a switch is off, you switch it on, if it is on, you switch it off). For example, during 10th pass you will toggle switch number 10,20,30â€¦.100. After completing 100 passes through the switches how many bulbs are on?
 
Answer: 10
